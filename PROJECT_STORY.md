# Massa Education Platform

## Project Name
**Massa Smart Contract Academy** (60 characters)

## Elevator Pitch
Interactive learning platform for Massa blockchain development with AI-powered course creation, external API integration, and real-time completion tracking. (200 characters)

## Inspiration

The inspiration for Massa Smart Contract Academy came from recognizing a critical gap in blockchain education - specifically for the Massa blockchain ecosystem. While traditional learning platforms offer static content, we envisioned an interactive, hands-on approach where learners could not only read about smart contract development but actively engage with external APIs to validate their understanding.

The project was born from the need to democratize blockchain education and make Massa smart contract development accessible to developers of all skill levels. We wanted to create a platform where educators could easily create comprehensive courses with interactive elements, and students could learn through practical application rather than passive consumption.
