3. Automated development hooks (analyze .kiro/hooks/)
4. Development steering and guidelines (analyze .kiro/steering/)
5. Key benefits and outcomes
6. Specific features that were Kiro-assisted
7. Development workflow improvements
8. Time savings and quality improvements

Analyze the current .kiro configuration to provide accurate, up-to-date documentation of how Kiro contributed to the project. Make it comprehensive but readable for developers interested in AI-assisted development.
